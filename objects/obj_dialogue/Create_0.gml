The player needs to fix a corrupted encryption key where the parity bit is wrong. First, explain symmetric encryption briefly: it uses one key for both encryption and decryption, and modern systems like AES use complex key schedules for security. If the key is compromised, the data is compromised. Then, tell them a corrupted key needs fixing: 0A 3F ?7 E2, where ?7's parity is invalid. Answer any follow-up questions about encryption, keys, or parity bits helpfully but stay in character as a frantic security guard.");

First, explain that storing passwords in plaintext is dangerous, and systems use 'salts' (random data) combined with hashing algorithms (ex: SHA-256) to protect passwords, and that salts prevent precomputed 'rainbow table' attacks. Then present this problem: the AI leaked our user database with a record showing Username: jsmith, Salt: D9%2f, Hash: a5f4c... The password is either 'bluefish' or 'moonlight', and the player needs to figure out which one matches the hash. Answer follow-up questions about password security, hashing, and salting while staying in character as a concerned developer.");
